\ i actualy tried to use this algorithm on a contract once where i had to
\ know the number of bits in a byte but my boss wouldnt let me use it
\ because he couldnt believe it would work no matter how much i explained
\ it (duh) - managers realy should trust their coders to know better than
\ they do what is and what is not the best solution!
