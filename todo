done fix fsave and turnkey so that brain dead gdb likes the elf files
done add vocabularies
done add hashed dictionary searches (nicely faster :)
done make fload memory map files
done   set 'tib to start address of memory mapped file

done   make refill unmap/close file
done use terminfo format strings for console i/o
done fix ^7 seffault bug (sorta)
done make fload accept the evil tab again (new fload b0rked this)

     the end of the line or tab (im assuming the char is a bl here)
done add a debugger (for high level and eventually coded defs)
done add command history
done add signals
